#Overview

This is a React-based Pokémon guessing game. The application fetches a random Pokémon from the PokéAPI, and the player must guess the name of the Pokémon based on its silhouette. Once the guess is submitted, the game reveals the Pokémon's image and tells the player if their guess was correct. After that, the player can proceed to the next Pokémon by clicking the "Next" button.
